### INTRODUCTION

Skin cancer detection is one of the major problems across the world. There is a
drastic increase in the rate of deaths due to lack of knowledge on the symptoms and their
prevention. Early detection of the skin cancer and its diagnosis is very important for the
further treatment of it. Skin cancer is further divided into various types like Melanoma
and Benign. In this research, we have used convolutional neural network for image
processing and recognition.Skin Cancer is one of the most dangerous and common disease that affect mankind
very often. The two main types of skin cancer that affect humans are Melanoma and Benign.
However, Melanoma is the most affecting and dangerous type of skin cancer. The World
Health Organization also estimated high cases of Melanoma across the world.
